# coin changer kata

# write a function that takes a number of cents, and then returns a hash containing the least number of coins needed to generate the value of cents.

eg. if you have 11 cents you should return {:dime => 1, :penny =>1} if you have 31 cents you should return {:quater => 1, :nickel => 1, :penny =>1"}; if 93 cents {:quarter => 3, :dime => 1, nickel =>1, penny: => 3}
